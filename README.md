# HW - Week 5: Workday Planner

* Worked solely w/ Jquery to build out the HTML elements:

    - Created 3 column var to contain Time / Description (txt) / Save (btn)
    - Only looking at 9 hours in the work day (9a - 5p)
    - Function changeAMPM changed to 12 hour time format

*  Ability to change color based on Past (white) Present (red) & future (green)

* Text is saved within local storage, and remains unchanged when page refreshed
